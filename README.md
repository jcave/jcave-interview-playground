# Challenge: Create a Calculator

## Instructions

Create a calculator that can perform 5 operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Remainder (modulus)

The calculator will need to take two real numbers as input. It will
also need to display the operation that is currently selected (images
have been included). The solution will need to be displayed after
it has been calculated. If you have extra time, keep and display a
history of all operations completed. See the mockups in the
screenshots folder for UI guidance.

## Goals

A working project, that can be run in a simulator or on device, which addresses the requirements stated in the instructions. As a rough estimate, plan to schedule about an hour to complete the assignment.

## How To Submit the Challenge

You will use a Pull Request in order to submit your playground work. Please do the following steps:

 * Create a branch off of `master` that will contain your work.
 * Make an initial empty commit to your branch. This will serve as a timestamp for when you have started the playground.
 * When time has expired and/or you have completed the playground, make your final commit to your branch, and then create a PR. The `Pull Request` tab on the repository should now have a `1` next to it, to indicate that your PR was successfully created.
